# Bashionista

Write better Bash utilities faster and easier.

## Features

- Easily define subcommands with bash functions.
- A help and bash completion command for free.
- Create a bundle of your bashionista script for others so they don't have to
  install bashionista.

## Installation

Simply place the bashonista file in a `$PATH` directory and make it executable.

## Bundle

Bundling makes it possible for scripts that are written using `Bashonista` to
be run without bashionista. This makes it easier for people to adopt your
scripts as they won't have to setup the Bashionista depedency.

Bundling of a bashionista script is done with the `bundle` subcommand.
